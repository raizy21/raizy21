# ☀️ good morning, world!

i am andrei – a proud morning person coding in the shadows of private repos, sipping coffee while the rest of the dev world is still asleep.

## 👤 who am i?

- 🛠️ i am an **amazonian** — fixing laptops by day, breaking code by night
- 🌅 morning person – i rise with the sun and bugs still clinging to last night’s code
- ⌨️ still ca not type `addEventListener` without autocomplete (one day… maybe)
- 🖱️ `ctrl+c`/`ctrl+v` is my preferred programming language
- ✍️ _i hate capital letters. if you see one, it is probably a typo or shift key betrayal._

## ⚡ my coding powers

> _half developer, half it support, fully confused but unstoppable._

- java, c, python, node.js, android studio
- react (html), javascript
- css and i are in a toxic relationship — i try, it ghosts me
- i touched php once. i try to recover now
- used to speak fluent react native… then had an accident and forgot half the syntax
- some sql i think, i am not sure
- expressjs, rest apis,postman, graphql,jest, typescript are words that i use to know
- my troubleshooting skills are so good, i once fixed a laptop by just walking into the room—out of fear, it update automatically after that of apologies.
- git, svn, and a dark mode obsession deeper than my sleep debt

## 🚧 what i am building

- learning web development **seriously** this time
- not sprinting back to react native (i made a promise… to myself and the bugs)

---

## 🎉 fun facts

- had an accident, now relearning code - web development
- bugs fear the morning, and so should they

  <strong>⚠️ and remember...</strong>

  <em>
    the code does not stop when it is hard.  
    it stops when you walk away from what you once believed you could build.
